  Pay tribute to the Egyptian God of Protection<br><br>

  Okay, here's the idea. You pay tribute to Bastet, which basically means paying money to mint NFTs in the form of protection crystals. Bugs that are discovered in any of the target protected networks, and disclosed in a coordinated way will earn payouts, or bonus payouts.
  Top crystal holders for any given org will also be delivered regular reports detailing the current threat profile of the organization under protection.
  As the knowledge of Bastet grows, so will her understanding of the global threat landscape. Crystal holders will be able to tap into this wisdom at a general level, or very specifically about a target orgnization.
  Extra incentives may exist for things like data collection, referrals. There will be no token, all incoming or outgoing payments will be in the form of DAI, a USD stablecoin.
